        Open Source database of web3 wallets that have been sanctioned or
        identified by LEA during investigations around the world and are tied to
        illegal activities such as money laundering, hacking, drug trafficking,
        CSAM, scams, fraud and other illicit activities.

      <h4>Problem Statement</h4>
      <p>
        More than 400 million wallets involving bitcoin, ethereum, USDT, and
        other active cryptocurrencies have been detected on the blockchain. Due
        to the anonymity of wallets, it becomes challenging to investigate,
        collect evidence, collaborate for compliance, combat crime, and ensure a
        secure web3 world.
